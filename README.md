Requires QueryMaster (http://querymaster.codeplex.com) and IKriv MathConverter (For some WPF elements, which I plan to rework)

DayZReborn\* is an open-source C#/WPF server browser and mod manager for the ArmA 2 mod, DayZ. It utilizes the .NET QueryMaster library created by betson. The goal is to have a completely customizable DayZ launcher. Outdated mod download link? Update it in a settings file. Want a different theme? Change the colours or use pre-made ones. It's also trivial to change which game's master server is queried, thanks to QueryMaster, making it easy to modify it for use with any game.

\*The current name is temporary, I am aware of the mod 'Reborn'. I will look at a new name once the program is in a functional state.
