# DayZReborn

A C#/WPF DayZ launcher. Basically Commander v2.

I've been working on this on and off for quite a while, in my spare time. I wanted to create an open source version of DayZ Launcher because, well... I don't like it. It's such a downgrade from the good old DayZCommander.

I plan on having everything customizable, from the theme to where the program looks for mods and installs them to.
