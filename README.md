Requires QueryMaster (http://querymaster.codeplex.com) and IKriv MathConverter (For some WPF elements, which I plan to rework)

DayZAnnex\* is an open-source C#/WPF server browser and mod manager for the ArmA 2 mod, DayZ. It utilizes the .NET QueryMaster library created by betson. The goal is to have a completely customizable and open source DayZ launcher.
